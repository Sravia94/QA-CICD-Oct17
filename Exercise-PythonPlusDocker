Exercise: Build a Docker network with a load balancer and application layer
time: 1 hour

In this exercise, you will now combine knowledge from previous sessions and build a docker network. 

Prerequisites: 
1) A linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04)
2) Install Docker on this linux VM
3) Open port 80 on the network 


Step 1: Build a docker network.
This docker network should have 2 containers as detailed in next steps. 

Step 2: Add containers to the network
1) Application Container: A python flask API built by you. This can be a very simple hello world example. 
    a) Build a python flask API that runs on port number 9000
    b) Create a Dockerfile that builds this container 
    c) Use docker build command to name this container as server
2) Load Balancer to take user requests: An Nginx container that take requests from the user and forwards it to a container called server on port 9000.

Step 3: Access the application 

Go to the IP address of the machine. Do you see your flask hello world here now?
